## How to Contribute

### Choosing an Issue

Before getting started and setup with contributing, you'll want to have a look at and choose an issue to work on. Following is the basic workflow you want to work from:

- Search through issues.
- Find issue you want to work on.
- Check if someone else has already worked on and made a pull request on said issue.
- (Optional) Double check pull requests for someone who has worked on the pull request.

If you have gotten that far, then you can go ahead and work on the issue. Below are more detailed instructions based on the basic workflow above.

### Pull Request Process

Please adhere to the following guideline for submitting a pull request:

- Please make sure to include a clear and concise commit message, including the issue number it addresses, for example "Fixes issue #12: Resolves a bug in the login feature." This will make it easier for maintainers to understand the changes made and track the progress of resolving the issue.
- Before submitting, please ensure that your code passes the linting checks and that there are no lint issues present in the code.
- Submit a pull request, ensuring that it follows the pull request template and includes a clear explanation of the changes made.
- Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and discussed.
- Make any necessary changes based on feedback.
- Pull Requests will be reviewed by at least two two project maintainers before being approved and merged into the main branch.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
