# DISABLE NON-CRITICAL CHECKS
# Here, we disable checks across certain categories
# * Checks that are not security weaknesses or are context dependent
#   (Missing S3 bucket versioning, missing description in security groups, etc.)
# * Tagging
# * Logging (network-level logs, not including VPC Flow Logs)
# * Logging (#-level logs, like S3 access logs)
#
# Other checks that are listed below in comments in case you want to exclude them (by uncommenting them)
